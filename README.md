#Histogram
This program analyzes a large body of text based on the word frequency. This is the third step of an NLP Tweet Generator project I'm working on.

##How it Works
1. The program takes in a text file of any length. I'm using text from The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes
2. The program returns a histogram of all the words in the body of text along with their frequencies
3. Another function within the program returns the number of unique words in the text.
4. Another function in the program produces a file containing the histogram
